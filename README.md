This is the repository in which the work for the Nomination program monitoring algorithm will take place / be finalized. 

## Build a Nomination Program Monitoring Algorithm for Avail

**Grant**: $3000 in USDT

**Applications open until**: (1 week from job posting, enter date) 

**Remote | Flexible Timeline | Protocol Growth Impact**

Avail launched the first phase of its **Nomination Program** in Q4 2024 to bring trust, decentralization, and performance alignment to validator selection. Read the full details here:

🔗 [AIP-4: Mainnet Nomination Program](https://forum.availproject.org/t/aip-4-mainnet-nomination-program/1571)

This pilot has been a success, and now it’s time to scale. We’re looking for a Core Dev to **build the backend monitoring algorithm** that will track validator performance and automate future nomination decisions.

You’ll take inspiration from Kusama’s 1KV program and tailor it to Avail’s updated metrics and weightings. If you’re a Polkadot/Substrate dev with a knack for backend monitoring systems, this one’s for you.

## Metrics and Weights for Nomination Program

You’ll implement the following verticals (weights provided):

### 🟦 **Performance — 40%**

- Faults (15 pts)
- Offline Time (10 pts)
- Unclaimed Rewards (3 pts)
- Inclusion in Active Set (7 pts)
- Discovery Tenure (5 pts)

### 🟩 **Bonded Stake — 40%**

- Bonded Amount (40 pts)

### 🟨 **Other Factors — 20%**

- Recent Nominations (5 pts)
- Rank in Validator Pool (5 pts)
- Geographic Diversity (5 pts)
- ISP Diversity (5 pts)
